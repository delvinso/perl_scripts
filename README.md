# perl_scripts


Random assortment and snippets of (mostly) bioinformatic related perl scripts.

I have only recently begun learning perl and am always open to improvements regarding my logic, syntax and structure (pretty much anything related to my code)! By no means do I suggest that any of my solutions are elegant or efficient in any way, but in most cases, I strive for logical and and straight forward code.
